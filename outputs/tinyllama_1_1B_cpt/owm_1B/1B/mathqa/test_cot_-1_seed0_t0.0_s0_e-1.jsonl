So, the area of the horse's grazing area is:\nArea of the horse's grazing area = 36 m \u00d7 20 m = 720 m^2.\nThe area of the field that the horse can graze is the area of the field minus the area of the rope and the area of the horse's grazing area:\nArea of the field that the horse can graze = 720 m^2 - 144 m^2 - 720 m^2 = 113 m^2.\nTherefore, the area of the field that the horse can graze is 113 m^2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (C)."], "pred": ["C"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
